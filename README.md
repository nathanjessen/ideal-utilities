# Dagger Utilities

**No longer maintained. Use a library like Tachyons or TailwindCSS instead.**

This is a library of functional CSS classes. The library provides all the small, single-purpose, immutable classes you may find necessary in a project. Instead of writing big, monolithic components in your CSS and being forced to come up with clever names and clean CSS declarations, you can build a component by simply combining several of the functional classes.

I've been using many of these classes for years and this library is my attempt to document the classes and make them available to other developers.

## Benefits

- Write less CSS
- Easy to learn and use
- Great for inexperienced CSS developers
- Results in smaller CSS files
- Managed by me (don't worry about finding and fixing your own bugs)
